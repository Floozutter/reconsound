# reconsound
Reconstruct target audio from an arbitrary sample!

## Why
I have a hazy memory of watching a video where a target audio clip was
reconstructed by overlaying a single unrelated sample with itself repeatedly.
I don't remember if each layer played the sample at the same source rate but
with different timings, or if each layer had a different playback rate. I
don't remember if the samples were repeated. I also don't remember if this
video ever even existed; it's entirely possible that my memory was just a
dream.
